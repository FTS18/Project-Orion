Understood — you want a **shorter, compressed, builder-safe SUPER PROMPT** that still includes **all functional requirements**, but fits within a smaller character limit so you can paste it into v0.dev / Bolt.new / Lovable / Windframe / Locofy / etc.

Here is the **compressed but complete** version that preserves ALL requirements:

---

# ✅ **COMPACT SUPER PROMPT (WORKS IN SITE BUILDERS, INCLUDES EVERYTHING REQUIRED)**

**Copy–paste directly — this version is optimized for token limits but keeps all rules intact.**

---

# **SUPER PROMPT (Compact Version)**

Build a full **Dual-Mode Agentic AI Loan Assistant** web app using **Next.js 14 (App Router + RSC + Server Actions)**, **TailwindCSS 3.4+**, **ShadCN/UI**, **TypeScript (strict)**, **CSS variables (design tokens)**, **Dark/Light mode**, and a **FastAPI backend** using **Ollama only (LLaMA3 / Mistral / Phi-3)**.
Use **SOLID principles**, Domain-Driven Design, modular architecture, clean separation of UI / domain / infrastructure / agents.

The site must have **two modes**:

---

## **MODE A — Standard UI Mode (No AI)**

Wizard flow for personal loan application:

1. Personal details
2. Loan details
3. KYC
4. Salary slip upload
5. Eligibility result
6. Sanction letter PDF download

UI requirements:

* ShadCN components
* Buttons, steppers, forms
* File upload
* Token-based theming (no hardcoded CSS)
* Responsive & animated

---

## **MODE B — Agentic AI Mode (Multi-Agent System)**

A demo mode showing AI workflow:

* Chat UI for **Master Agent**
* Panels for **Sales**, **Verification**, **Underwriting**, **Sanction Letter Agent**
* Logs console
* Workflow graph
* Auto-run + step-by-step
* State viewer

AI must run on **Ollama only**, using LangGraph/CrewAI patterns. Master Agent orchestrates Worker Agents.

---

# **BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (FastAPI)**

Implement these exact REST endpoints:

**POST /verify-kyc** → input `{customerId, name, phone, address}` → output `{status, mismatches[]}`
**POST /extract-salary** → upload PDF/image → output `{grossIncome, netIncome, employer, parsed}`
**POST /underwrite** → input `{customerId, loanRequest:{amount, tenure, rate}}` → output `{decision, reason, requiredAction}`
**POST /generate-sanction-letter** → returns PDF URL
**GET /crm/:customerId** → dummy KYC
**GET /credit/:customerId** → `{score, preApprovedLimit}`
**GET /offers** → mock Offer-Mart offers

---

# **AGENT RULES (must follow exactly)**

### **Underwriting Agent**

* If creditScore < 700 → REJECT
* If loanAmount ≤ preApprovedLimit → APPROVE
* If loanAmount ≤ 2× preApprovedLimit → request salary slip →

  * Extract salary
  * Compute EMI
  * EMI ≤ 50% of net salary → APPROVE
  * Else → REJECT
* If loanAmount > 2× limit → REJECT

### **Verification Agent**

* Phone + name must match CRM
* Address must match pincode/city
* Else return PENDING

### **Sales Agent**

* Collect amount, tenure, purpose
* Suggest offer from Offer-Mart
* Return structured JSON loan request

### **Sanction Letter Agent**

* Only runs after approval
* Creates PDF with customer info + loan terms + sanction ID

Ollama prompts must be included in code (no GPT allowed).

---

# **DATA REQUIREMENTS (must include)**

Create `data/customers.csv` + `data/customers.json` with **10 synthetic customers**, each containing:

`customerId, name, age, city, phone, email, existingLoan, existingLoanAmount, creditScore, preApprovedLimit, employmentType, monthlyNetSalary`

Also include:

* Offer-Mart mock API
* CRM mock API
* Credit Bureau mock API
* Sample salary slip PDFs

---

# **DELIVERABLES THE GENERATOR MUST OUTPUT**

1. Full folder tree
2. All source code (Next.js + FastAPI)
3. Config files (next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, tsconfig.json, requirements.txt)
4. Design tokens + CSS variables + theme system
5. Two modes: `/apply` + `/agentic`
6. Agents + orchestrator code
7. mock APIs + synthetic data
8. PDF generator template
9. README with setup (Ollama install, backend run, frontend run)
10. Demo script (4-min)
11. Architecture diagram (ASCII)
12. Unit test stubs for underwriting + verification

If you want, I can also generate:

* A **super-compressed version** under 2,000 characters
* A **minimal builder prompt** for strict token limits
* A **JSON-encoded version** for models that require escape formatting
* A **one-page submission-ready version** for judges

Tell me what format you want.
